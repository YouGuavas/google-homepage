This is my attempt at [The Odin Project's](http://www.theodinproject.com/) first html/css project(easy version): Reconstruct Google's homepage. Through their assignments to this point, I've learned valuable skills in basic html/css, git/github, as well as how to effectively use Chrome's Developer Tools. 

In completing this project, I learned how to begin to use Chrome's Dev Tools to poke and prod at unfamiliar features of foreign web pages until I understand and can implement them in my own pages, not dissimilar from reverse engineering.
